// Write an "assertWithinRange" function from scratch.

// The idea here is similar to when someone says, "Give me a number between 1 and 5". 
// You usually think the possible answers are "1, 2, 3, 4, or 5".  I.e., you usually don't interpret the options as being "2, 3, or 4".  

// Notes:
// * Assume that the "actual" and "expected" arguments are always numbers (e.g., not booleans or other types that don't make sense in the context of examining a "range".)


function assertWithinRange(low, high, actual, testName) {
  // your code here
  if (actual < low) {
    return "FAIL " + testName + " " + actual + " not within range " + low + " to " + high; 
  }
  else if (actual > high) {
    return "FAIL " + testName + " " + actual + " not within range " + low + " to " + high; 
  }
  else {
    return "passed"
  }
}
